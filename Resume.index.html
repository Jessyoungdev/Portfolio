        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>My family and I moved here to St. George about a year ago. My husband is a product manager in the fintech industry and I have owned and run several of my own small businesses. I started a small business building websites and consulting because I wanted to help local small businesses in California get online to be discovered. I originally started using web builders and found myself wanting more control and customization. I have been studying and learning code for the last year by taking courses online and working hard everyday to add to my own personal portfolio. I love to learn and have found that coding allows me to create and solve the problems/puzzles that I enjoy.</p>
